Paywall/Subscription Wall - Re-enable Instructions
===============================================

To re-enable the paywall/subscription wall for your Figma plugin, you need to uncomment the following code blocks:

1. **Backend (src/code.ts):**
   - Uncomment the block in the translate handler that checks for subscription status and credits.
   - The block is marked with:
     // PAYWALL DISABLED FOR TESTING - uncomment to re-enable

2. **Frontend/UI (src/ui.html):**
   - Uncomment the block in the `updateButtonState` function that changes the button to 'Subscribe Now!' and disables translation when not subscribed.
   - Uncomment the block in the `translateBtn.onclick` handler that triggers the subscribe flow if not subscribed and out of credits.
   - Both blocks are marked with:
     // PAYWALL DISABLED FOR TESTING - uncomment to re-enable

After uncommenting these blocks, the paywall will be active again for users who are not subscribed or out of credits.
